It's really more of a tech demo using zig and raylib.

## How to build
You can build for web so long as you have emscripten installed with `./build_web.sh`.

You can also build for desktop on windows / mac / linux by running `zig build run`.

This was made using `zig 0.14.1` so you may need to use that exact release to build this in the future.
